# Dynamic Programming

* Correctness of brute force and efficiency of greedy algorithms
* Two common use cases
  * Find an **optimal solution**
  * **Counting** the total number of **solutions** for a problem
* Identifying and solving all sub problems
* Dynamic Programming = Recursion + Memoization

## Bottom-Up Approach
* Solve the base problem from the bottom
* Use solution of base problems to solve super problem
