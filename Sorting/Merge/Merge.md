# Merge Sort

* __Merge Sort is an efficient, stable, and comparison-based sorting algorithm. It follows the divide-and-conquer paradigm and works by dividing the input array into two halves, sorting each half, and then merging the sorted halves.__
* the mergeSort method recursively divides the array into halves until each subarray has one or zero elements. 
* Then, the merge method combines the sorted subarrays into a single sorted array. 

Complexity __O(n log n)__
