# Insertion Sort

* __Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time.__
* The outer loop iterates through the array, and for each iteration, the inner loop moves elements greater than the current key to one position ahead of their current position (to right).
* Current key will be inserted at the position of current iteration 
* Each loop inserts the current key (of current tieration) at the right position of the leading sub array

Complexity __O(n^2)__
