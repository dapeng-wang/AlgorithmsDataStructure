# Selection Sort

* __Selection Sort is another simple sorting algorithm that sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and putting it at the beginning.__
* The outer loop iterates through the array, and for each iteration, the inner loop finds the index of the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array. 
* The minimum element is then swapped with the first element in the unsorted part.
* Each iteration determines the min element at position i

Complexity __O(n^2)__
