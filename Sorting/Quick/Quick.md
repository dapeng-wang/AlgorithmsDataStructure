# Quick Sort

* __QuickSort is a widely used sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer paradigm. It works by selecting a "pivot" element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The process is then applied recursively to the sub-arrays.__
* the quickSort method recursively sorts the sub-arrays by partitioning them around a pivot element. 
* The partition method selects the pivot and rearranges the elements such that elements less than the pivot are on the left, and elements greater than the pivot are on the right. 

Complexity __O(n log n)__

Worst case: __O(n^2)__
