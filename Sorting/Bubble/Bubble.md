# Bubble Sort

* __Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.__
* The bubbleSort method takes an array of integers and sorts it using the bubble sort algorithm. 
* The outer loop controls the number of passes through the array, and the inner loop compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. 
* If no swap in the inner loop is required, it means all elements are already in the right order. Whole process can be stopped. 
* The process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.

Complexity __O(n^2)__
